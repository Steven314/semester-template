# Semester Template

## make

There is a `Makefile` here which allows you to create homework or projects based on a template.

To put a new Typst homework assignment in the homework directory:

```cmd
make homework name=homework1
```

To put a new Quarto project in the projects directory:

```cmd
make project name=project1 type=qmd
```
